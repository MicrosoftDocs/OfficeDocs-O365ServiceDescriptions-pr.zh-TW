As an authorized Microsoft partner, Microsoft Office 365 offers you an opportunity to grow your customer base and create lasting relationships with them. For a monthly or annual fee paid to you, your customers can use cloud-based services so they don't have to manage data backups, server hardware, and server updates. The services available to you depend on the types of services you are authorized to provide.
  
> [!NOTE]
> For more information on how to use partner features, see [Build your business and administer your Office 365 partner subscription](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=271614&amp;clcid=0x409) and review the partner features presentation. To receive access to the partner features, you can join Cloud Essentials by signing the [Microsoft Online Services Partner Agreement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=285473). 
  
## <a name="create-trial-invitations-and-purchase-orders"></a>建立試用邀請和採購單

You can create and send trial invitations to your customers so they can try Office 365 by using the **Partner overview** page in Office 365. The invitation can contain one or more services, depending on the offer. If you're certified to offer delegated administration, you can add an option to the trial invitation that allows you to administer the account on behalf of your customer. This makes it easier for your customer to try Office 365. 
  
After you've sent a trial invitation for Office 365 to a customer, you can follow up by creating and sending a purchase offer that's customized to fit the needs of your customer including the specific services and the number of licenses your customer needs. If you're certified to offer delegated administration, you can add the option to the purchase offer that allows you to administer the account on behalf of your customer.
  
## <a name="provide-delegated-administration"></a>提供委派管理

Delegated administration allows a partner to have full administrative access to all the customer's services and subscriptions. This means you can perform administrative tasks on behalf of customers (including setting up mailboxes, adding or removing users and groups, data migration, and submitting service requests to Microsoft Customer Service and Support). Delegated administration capability is offered exclusively for partners who are enrolled in Cloud Essentials, Cloud Accelerate or the Cloud Deployment programs.
  
Before you can start administering a customer's account, the customer must authorize you as a delegated administrator. To get customer approval, you send them an offer for delegated administration, which you can include with a trial invitation or purchase offer. The customer authorizes a Delegated Administration partner by responding to the partner's invitational email.
  
每個客戶都有權擁有一個委派的系統管理合作夥伴。 此合作夥伴也可以是客戶的記錄可查夥伴 (POR)，但不一定要兩者相同。 POR 和委派的系統管理合作夥伴的角色是分開的，由客戶分別指定兩者。 這種設計可讓客戶選擇一個合作夥伴負責採購建議，並選擇另一個合作夥伴負責實作或受管理服務。 這也可讓合作夥伴針對自身的專業，選擇是否要接受其中一或兩種角色。
  
即使客戶已授權合作夥伴來代表執行系統管理工作，客戶仍可以直接連絡 Microsoft 支援服務並提交服務要求。
